# PB-Project
Project making a made up personal business website.
Here are the directions:

--Basic multi-page website--
I would like a website built for my personal business that I can show to customers if they want to know more information about my business. 
--Goals--
NO jQuery!!!
Separate files for CSS and JS. No inline CSS or JS Code.
Try to use NPM to get modules for your project and implement them. This may make your life easier once you figure them out.
---Layout---
1st and foremost the entire site should be responsive and look great and function on mobile and desktop. All screen sizes.
I would like a navigation bar on the top of the page that stays at the top of the screen and in view even when scrolling down the page. This should include the business name as well. Mobile i would like to collapse the nav bar into a hamburger menu/side bar (When i push the hamburger button, push the sidebar out).
    --On the Nav Bar--
        * Home
        * About My Business
        * Blog
        * Services
            * List of services dropdown in the nav bar
        * Pricing
        * Contact
Place a background color gradient on the page that is not a solid color. It should have some depth. I do not want an image on the background
--Home--
This should have a welcome message on the screen that welcomes the user to the site and a brief mission statement about the business. This could be generated Lorem Ipsum text if you want. But i would like mission statement sub heading and a welcome header. 
--About my business--
Talk about something about the business with a header in the body that matches other pages format. This could be generated Lorem Ipsum text if you want. 
--Blog--
This does not have to function completely. Without a database, this should not function. Really just have a placeholder for this page and say like Coming soon or something and create a shell where the blog posts will go. 
--Services--
This should just go to a page with that service and pictures/information about the service. 
--Pricing--
I would like this in a formatted table that looks nice. Maybe make the actual columns sortable if you can (click on it and it can sort ascending or descending.
--Contact--
This is the only form on the entire site. Blog will have a form to complete for the user posting the blog post, but that is later. The contact form should have a 4 required fields--
    * Name
    * Email
    * Subject
    * Message body
If you can format the message or include a WIZIWIG editor then that would be great for the message body. Instead of POSTing the form to a database, on submit, open up a mailto: link and the formatted email should open up in whatever the default email client/site is for mailto: links. 
The entire site should have some sort of theme that carries over to all pages. Use CSS as separate files. JS as separate files. Do not do inline CSS or inline JS. Please refrain from using jQuery and use Vanilla javascript if possible. If you feel like you need help with anything, reach out to me.
